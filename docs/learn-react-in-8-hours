### How React DOM works:

- What react basically does is this: We have a `div` with `id=root` in `public/index.html`. 
- We bind a component called `App` from `src/index.js` by finding the `id=root`.
- The `App` component declared in `src/App.js` is the core of everything you see in the web page.

### Notes on JSX Components:

- A react component must always return a HTML code.
- The name of the function (React component) should always start with a Capital letter.
